# Account Isolation Security Implementation

## Overview
Each Sky IQ account now has completely isolated Twilio integration and call data access. This ensures no cross-contamination between different users' data.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Isolated Twilio Connections
- **No Shared Client**: Each user has their own Twilio client created on-demand
- **Credential Validation**: User credentials validated before any operations
- **Phone Number Uniqueness**: System prevents multiple accounts from using the same Twilio number
- **Webhook Isolation**: Each user's webhooks are configured with their own credentials

### 2. Call Data Isolation
- **User-Specific Queries**: All call queries filter by userId to ensure data separation
- **Secure Call Creation**: Calls are only created for verified users with matching Twilio numbers
- **No Cross-Account Access**: Users can only view, create, and delete their own calls

### 3. Business Profile Isolation
- **User-Specific Business Data**: Business info queries are restricted to the requesting user
- **Secure Twilio Settings**: Each user's Twilio credentials are stored and accessed separately
- **No Data Leakage**: No endpoint allows viewing other users' business information

## API Endpoints Security

### Twilio Integration Endpoints
- `POST /api/twilio/setup/:userId` - Sets up isolated Twilio integration for specific user
- `POST /api/twilio/numbers/:userId` - Gets phone numbers from user's own Twilio account
- `POST /api/twilio/webhook` - Routes incoming calls to correct user based on phone number

### Call Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/calls/user/:userId` - Returns only calls belonging to specified user
- `POST /api/calls` - Creates calls with proper user validation
- `DELETE /api/calls/:id` - Verifies ownership before deletion

### Business Profile Endpoints
- `GET /api/business/:userId` - Returns business info only for specified user
- `POST /api/business/:userId` - Updates business info with user validation

## Call Routing Logic

### Webhook Processing
1. Twilio sends webhook data to `/api/twilio/webhook`
2. System extracts phone numbers from webhook (To/From)
3. Finds user by matching their Twilio phone number
4. Creates call record for that specific user only
5. No call data is shared between accounts

### User Phone Number Matching
```javascript
// Strict phone number matching ensures no cross-contamination
const userNumber = this.normalizePhoneNumber(info.twilioPhoneNumber);
const callNumber = this.normalizePhoneNumber(direction === 'inbound' ? to : from);

// Exact match ensures no cross-contamination between accounts
if (userNumber === callNumber) {
  // Route call to this user's account
}
```

## Data Flow Security

### New Account Setup
1. User provides their own Twilio credentials
2. System validates credentials are authentic
3. System checks phone number is not already in use
4. System verifies user owns the phone number
5. Webhooks configured for that user's account only

### Call Processing
1. Twilio webhook received with call data
2. Phone number matched to specific user account
3. Call record created for that user only
4. User sees call in their dashboard only

### Dashboard Access
1. User logs into their account
2. Dashboard queries filter by user ID
3. Only that user's calls and business data displayed
4. No access to other accounts' information

## Validation Rules

### Phone Number Uniqueness
- Each Twilio phone number can only be associated with one Sky IQ account
- System prevents conflicts during setup
- Error returned if phone number already in use

### Credential Security
- User Twilio credentials stored securely per account
- No shared credentials between users
- Each user manages their own Twilio integration

### Access Control
- All API endpoints validate user ownership
- Database queries filtered by user ID
- No cross-account data access possible

## Testing Account Isolation

To verify account isolation is working:

1. **Create Multiple Accounts**: Set up accounts with different Twilio numbers
2. **Make Test Calls**: Verify calls route to correct account dashboards
3. **Check Data Separation**: Confirm users only see their own data
4. **Validate Security**: Ensure no API endpoint allows cross-account access

## Implementation Status

✅ **Isolated Twilio Connections** - Each account has separate Twilio client  
✅ **Secure Call Routing** - Calls routed by phone number to correct user  
✅ **User-Specific Data Access** - All queries filtered by user ID  
✅ **Phone Number Validation** - Prevents conflicts between accounts  
✅ **Credential Isolation** - Each user's Twilio settings stored separately  
✅ **Webhook Security** - Proper routing based on phone number matching  

Your Sky IQ platform now ensures complete account isolation with secure Twilio integration for each user.
